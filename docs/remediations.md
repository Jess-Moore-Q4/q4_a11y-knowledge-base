# Remediations
Remediations can come to the accessibility team in multiple formats: 

## Internal - Single Occasion
Conduct a scan using [EA's internal scan tool](./automated-scanner.md)

### Benchmark
- Clear all critical errors
- 85% ASLint score
- 100% WAVE score
- If under time, clear as much of the remaining issues given the remaining time.

## Internal - Subscription
TBD

## External - Single Occasion
If a client chooses to provide their own scan, an audit must be provided in a format that meet the requirements outlined in the "Third Party Accessibility Audits" [document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c7www59b6nsxapc/Q4%20Activations%20-%20Third%20Party%20Accessibility%20Audits.pdf?dl=0). Most of the time, external scans will be the results of an automated scan - however, clients can opt to partner with companies that perform manual audits such as Accessible360.
